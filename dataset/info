1. Dataset information

This dataset accompanies the paper entitled "Mean Birds: Detecting Aggression and Bullying on Twitter", which is published in the ACM WebScience Conference, 2017. It contains anonymized information on the "annotated batches" of a selected set of Twitter users.

2. Description of file

The "data" file contains the list of all the annotated batches that were used in the paper.

Each row corresponds to a given batch, and is tab-delimited into the following 3 fields:
- user id: a random id for each user.
- annotation: whether the user has been characterized as normal, spammer, aggressor, or bully by a majority of crowd workers.
- tweets ids: a set of tweets ranging from 5 to 10.

Overall, the dataset includes 1,303 users with 9,484 tweets.
